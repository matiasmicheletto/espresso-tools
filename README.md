# Espresso tools

Here you will find some cheap tools and accesories I've parametrically designed with OpenScad. Most of these parts were adapted to my needs, but the parametric modelling allows to easily adjust parameters to cover many cases.  

## Available models

  - [x] 58 mm Dosing funnel: Compatible with the integrated grinder of the Oster Perfect Brew automatic expresso machine.  

## Work in progress
  - [ ] WDT Tool: Weiss Distribution Technique tool with its holder.   
  - [ ] Tamping base: A model to convert a VW beetle piston (!) into a tamping base. Compatible with 58 mm porta-filters.
